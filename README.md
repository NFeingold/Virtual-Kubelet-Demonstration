# Virtual-Kubelet-Demonstration

A follow along demonstration of using Virtual Kubelet for IoT Edge Deployments

This is a semi-comprehensive beginner-level demonstration of setting up Virtual Kubelet for Edge Deployments.
I will be borrowing content from my other [Github Pages](https://github.com/NFeingold), and referencing many outside documents that I will source.

We will be sending out a simulated temperature sensor deployment onto a raspberry pi
