# Useful Links

Not everything in here is just for beginners. Some of it is just interesting information related to the topics of Kubernetes or Iot Edge
that I would reccomend reading. If you find other documents or new updates for links I have provided, please feel free to let me know at
nfeingold@attunix.com, and I would be happy to review and add them.

## Kubernetes

- [Kubernetes Glossary](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?fundamental=true)
    This was one of the most influential websites for my beginning learning, as I was able to look up *every* confusing word, write them down, and have for reference.

- [What is Kubernetes?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMOZCDhH7do) 
    This is a short video that explains the basics of what Kubernetes is in nearly plain english. I highly recommend watching this 2 minute video if this is your first time interacting with Kubernetes.


- [Kubernetes Cheat Sheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/)
    While I usually just google for my kubectl commands, this is a nice master list of common ones you are likely to run. Also remember you can type ```kubectl --help``` in the command line for other options!
    
- [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes)
    While I didn't personally use this, if this is your first time, it is a great little course to familiarize yourself with what you will be doing! It is a free online interactive tutorial where you do many Kubernetes basics, broken down into digestable chunks.
    
## Virtual Kubelet    
    
- [Virtual Kubelet Demonstration- Azure Fridays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-R2mV7Bxuk)
    This video is what closely inspired this demonstration. The primary difference between the example in this video and this demonstration is that the video deploys to virtual machines rather than  Pi. **I highly recommend watching this video.**
    
- [Virtual Kubelet GitHub](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet)
    You will find this link spattered throughout this demonstration, however I think it is important to look at and read (and look at their examples!).
    
- [Virtual Kubelet IoT Edge Connector GitHub](https://github.com/azure/iot-edge-virtual-kubelet-provider)
    Similar to the previous link, you will also find this throughout this demonstration. This is the primary source that will be used in this demonstration, and all credit really goes to this team and the teams that they borrowed from that made the afformentioned Virtual Kubelet.
    
- [Virtual Kubelet](https://erikstmartin.com/post/virtual-kubelet/) This is an *amazing* article I highly recommend reading if you want to have a deeper understanding of what virtual kubelet is/how it works. It is begginner friendly but dives into good detail for those that are more curious.
    
- [Kubernetes for Edge Computing](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-for-edge-computing-the-microsoft-azure-approach/) 
    While this link doesn't really teach much, it is an interesting read that explains a lot of the benefits and basics of the virtual kubelet.
    
- [Virtual Kubelet Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19Ndu11WBCCBDowo9CrrGUHoIfd2L8Ueg) 
    This page is infrequently updated, but theres some interesting reads and meet ups are scheduled on there
    
## Azure/ IoT Hub/ IoT Edge

- [What is Azure IoT Edge?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/about-iot-edge)
    I think the title of the link says it all!
    
- [What is Azure IoT Hub?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/about-iot-hub)
    Once again, the link title summarzies this pretty well.

- [az aks Cheat Sheat](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aks?view=azure-cli-latest)
    This is just a list of all the ```az aks``` commands and how to fully utilize them.

    Don't forget to take frequent breaks, stand up, drink water, and stretch your hands!
