# Welcome to Useful Links

Not everything in here is just for beginners. Some of it is just interesting information related to the topics of Kubernetes or Iot Edge
that I would reccomend reading. If you find other documents or new updates for links I have provided, please feel free to let me know at
nfeingold@attunix.com, and I would be happy to review and add them.

## Beginner Level

- [Kubernetes Glossary](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?fundamental=true)<br/>
    This was one of the most influential websites for my beginning learning, as I was able to look up *every* confusing word, write them down, and have for reference.
